-<b>Total, Allowed, and Blocked Connections:</b> Displays the total number of connections processed by the firewall, highlighting those categorized as allowed or blocked.

-<b>Blocked Connections â€“ Location:</b> Uses a map to visualize the geographical distribution of blocked connections.

-<b>Suspicious Port Scanning Activity:</b> Detects potential scanning behavior by displaying source IPs, the number of contacted destinations, and the originating country.

<h2>Dashboard Setup</h2>

<h3><b><p align="center">
All Connections Panel <br/> 
</b></h3>

<b><p align="center">
SPL Query: <br/> 
</b>
```
index=botsv2 sourcetype="pan:*" action=blocked OR action=allowed
| stats count by action
| stats sum(count)
```
<b>It retrieves all blocked and allowed actions, counts them, and then aggregates the values to provide a total numerical result.</b>

<h3><b><p align="center">
Blocked/Allowed Connections Panel <br/> 
</b></h3>

<b><p align="center">
SPL Query: <br/> 
</b>
```
index=botsv2 sourcetype="pan:*"
| stats count by action
| search action=blocked  <--#switch with allowed and repeat procees
| table count
```
<b>The process is similar to the first panel, but the SPL queries differ, as they do not compute a combined sum of allowed and blocked actions, but rather handle them separately.</b>
